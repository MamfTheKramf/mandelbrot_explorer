# About the Project
This program recycles some code from my computergraphics course and uses some Qt and OpenGL to render the mandelbrot set and the julia set. You can zoom in and out and move around to explore the fractals.
The window title tells you what side is currently under control and also what constant is currently selected for the julia set.

# Controls
- `space`: switch active side,
- `n`: zoom out,
- `m`: zoom in,
- `arrow keys`: move around,
- `mouse left`: select a constant for the julia set
